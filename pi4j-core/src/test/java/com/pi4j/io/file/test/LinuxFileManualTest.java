/**
 * This is a test program that is intended to be run inside a debugger
 * and not run as part of the JUint testing.  The reason for this is that
 * the JUnit version, @See LinuxFileTest, can only test that some value
 * comes back for the Posix File Descriptior number.  With a debugger,
 * the myFile variable can be examped to see what the private FD value is
 * and that number can be compared to the output of this program.
